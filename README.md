# Bazar.com: A Multi-tier Online Book Store

This project aims to implement Bazar.com, the world's smallest book store, with a two-tier web design employing microservices. The front-end tier accepts user requests, while the back-end consists of a catalog server and an order server. This README will guide you through setting up and testing the system.
